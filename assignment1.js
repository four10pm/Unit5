// - Must be closed in the correct order 
// - Should have a corresponding opening bracket of the same type 
// Ex. Input: s = "()" Output: true

// QUESTION 2
// There are n people in a line waiting to purchase tickets, with the 0th person at the front and the (n - 1)th person at the back. 
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array of tickets of length n, where tickets[I] represents the number of tickets that the ith person wishes to purchase. 
// Each person purchases a ticket in exactly one second. 
// A person can only purchase one ticket at a time and must return to the end of the line (which happens instantly) to purchase additional tickets. 
// If a person has no more tickets to buy, he or she will leave the line. 
// Return the time spent for the individual atâ€¯position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets. 
// Example: Input: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2 Output: 6

// let tickets = [2, 3, 2] -> going through the array once takes 3 seconds because there are 3 people
// tickets turn 1 -> [1, 2, 1] -> going through the array twice takes 3*2 seconds because there are 3 people, twice
// tickets turn 2 -> [0, 1, 0] -> going through the array three times, take 7 seconds, because on the third round only one person remains

// QUESTION 3
// You are given an array heights representing the heights of students in a class. 
// The students are standing in a line, and their heights are listed in the order they appear from left to right. 
// The school wants to arrange the students in a non-decreasing order by their heights. 
//However, when they rearrange the students, a few may end up in different positions from their original positions.

// You need to write a function heightChecker(heights) that determines the minimum number of students who are not standing in the correct positions after the rearrangement. 
// Implement the function heightChecker and return the minimum number of students who are not positioned correctly.

// ex. Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3] Output: 3
